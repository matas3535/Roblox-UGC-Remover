# Roblox UGC Remover
Tool that allows you to permanently remove a UGC item from your inventory, Made as all the old ones seem to be outdated and no longer work.

Press **CTRL + Shift + I** to open the developer tools or find it in your browsers application menu dropdown, Then head over to the console tab and paste the code from the [File Page](https://github.com/matas3535/Roblox-UGC-Remover/blob/main/program.js) (Keep in mind you have to type 'allow pasting' to be able to paste code into the console).

Should look like this if it succeeded:
